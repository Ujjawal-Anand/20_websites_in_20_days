###[navigation-bar with dropdown menu] (http://codepen.io/andy1729/full/wKeJYX/)
> Date: 8 Oct 2015

 Today I learned about creation a navigation bar with dropdown menu, the main chalange was making the submenu hidden and make them visible on hovering over the parent which was achieved using css property visibility, I also applied wipe-down effect from yesterday's project to achieve some cool animation effect.
