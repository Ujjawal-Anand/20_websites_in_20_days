###[Just-another navigation-bar](http://codepen.io/andy1729/full/EVXdZg/)
> Date: 9 Oct 2015

#### Target
  Use of basic CSS techniques to create a navigation bar with cool hover effect

#### Level
  Beginner

#### Demo
  [Here](http://codepen.io/andy1729/full/EVXdZg/)

#### Things I learned
   Just a much better grip on old things that I have learned till now doing this project.

   I used previous learned topics to make a navigation-bar.The cool thing about this navigation bar is, when you hover over the menus a nice transition-effect is generated.
 
 You know, it's been 6 days since I started this project and now I can see the improvements right away but still have a long way to go.

#### Thought of the day
   [codepen](http://codepen.io/) is just great.
