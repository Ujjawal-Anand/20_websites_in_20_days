###[Just-another navigation-bar] (http://codepen.io/andy1729/full/EVXdZg/)
> Date: 9 Oct 2015

  Today, I used previous learned topics to make a navigation-bar.The cool thing about this navigation bar is, when you hover over the menus a nice transition-effect is generated.
 
 You know, it's been 6 days since I started this project and now I can see the improvements right away but still have a long way to go.
