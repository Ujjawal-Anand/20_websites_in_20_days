> Date:17 October 2015

#### Target
  Creating a countdown timer using Javascript.

#### Level
  Beginner (Javascript)

#### Demo
  <a href="http://codepen.io/andy1729/full/pjdLJX/" target="_blank">Here</a>


#### Things I learned
  When for the first time javascript code worked it was like dream coming true.Finally I am doing things about which I have dreamed so many times.Learned about showing current date and time and dynamically updating it using javascript.Thanks to sitepoint for a <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/build-javascript-countdown-timer-no-dependencies/" target="_blank">great and elaborting tutorial.</a> I just followed the very tutorial.

  One more particular thing I will like to mention- "At first I wrote the code at codepen and it was working there but when I ran the same code on my browser locally(I wrote the html, css and an external javascript file) it wasn't working and that was quite frustrating but then I removed the external js file link from the head part of html and include it at the bottom in body part and after saving and refreshing, it worked!"

#### Thought of the day
  "I should be proud of myself."
